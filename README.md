# Mobile-Phone-Predict-Pricing
​In today's rapidly evolving mobile phone market, accurately predicting the price range of a device based on its features is invaluable for both consumers and manufacturers. Consumers can make informed purchasing decisions, while manufacturers can strategically position their products. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict mobile phone price ranges using various device specifications.​


By leveraging supervised learning algorithms, the model analyzes features such as battery power, RAM, internal memory, camera quality, and connectivity options to classify mobile phones into distinct price categories. The dataset utilized encompasses a wide range of mobile devices with corresponding specifications and price labels.​


The primary objective is to build an accurate and reliable predictive model that assists stakeholders in understanding the correlation between mobile phone features and their market prices. This endeavor not only enhances consumer decision-making but also aids manufacturers in optimizing product pricing strategies.​
